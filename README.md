# GoGame
I'm writing a program that allows two people to play go.

### Phases
1. Get the game to work accurately in the terminal
    - allow for moves while remembering state and score
    - check for illegal moves
    - implement accurate scoring
2. Port the program into a webapp using flask
3. allow two people to connect to the webserver, choose sides, and play on separate browsers.

### TODO for current phase (1)
- Check for illegal moves (suicide, ko)
- Improve scoring to account for territory held by each side at the end
